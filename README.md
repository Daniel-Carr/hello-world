CTI-110-O1 Hello World Assignment

This is Daniel Carr and this is not my first experience in GitHub; I am also working with an experienced programmer on an integration project for my work, and we do our version control through GitHub. I enjoy spending time out in the world and at home with my girlfriend Kelly, as well as playing video games online with my friends, cooking, and watching anime.
