CTI-110-O1 Hello World Assignment

This is Daniel Carr and this is not my first experience in GitHub; I am also working with an experienced programmer on an integration project for my work, and we do our version control through GitHub. I enjoy spending time out in the world and at home with my girlfriend, as well as playing video games online with my friends, cooking, and watching anime.

Today is February 10, 2019.
